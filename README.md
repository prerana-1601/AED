# AED - Adjusted Euclidean Distance
 Implementing adjusted Euclidean Distance for Memory-based Collaborative Filtering
 
Although the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) method, also known as memory-based Collaborative Filtering, has proven to be highly successful, it still encounters challenges, such as accurately estimating the similarity between users or items. Fortunately, data scientists and researchers are diligently working to enhance the KNN-based Collaborative Filtering method.

A particular solution proposed to improve the KNN-based Collaborative Filtering method involves using Euclidean Distance. This solution is detailed in a report titled “A New Similarity Measure Based on Adjusted Euclidean Distance for Memory-based Collaborative Filtering.”

I have implemented this solution using Python, applying the formulas mentioned in the report to a movie dataset that contains data on how 943 users have rated 1,682 movies.
